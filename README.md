- _Start_ button will navigate to the main game.
- Player will have weapons to pick up to fight off zombies
- Enemies will appear from anywear to chase the player

We want to keep the GUI as simple and clear as possible by having a simple map, simple player and 2 types of enemies

### üé® Assets

I used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

I plan on following trends already found in other survival game, a game i use to play is [Superfighters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/855860/Superfighters_Deluxe/) which is where i got my inspiration from

The GUI will be kept simple and playful, as to make sure the game is easy to understand what each component does and is, as well as light hearted to keep to the Survival game theme

#### üñºÔ∏è Images
- Most images will from the map used [here](https://anokolisa.itch.io/legacy-adventure-pack-cemetery)
#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

For fonts, a simple sans-serif like Roboto will look quite nice. It's a font that is legible, light on storage size, and fun to keep with the theme we're going for. We also used a more cartoonish Pokemon font for the title screen.

#### üîä Sounds

All sounds were taken from [here](https://brooklyn-game-audio-team.itch.io/2000) for the gameplay music
